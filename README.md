# ðŸ’» web doodles 
A mixed bag of tiny web projects, the result of my fondness for - 

* The weird and wonderful 90s web of my early teens.
* Learning with lots of little projects like <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days</a> or <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code</a>.
* Restraint in an ever more complex frontend JavaScript universe; things like the <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">10k Apart competition</a> and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low-Tech Magazine</a>, and keeping in mind that what much of the tech world would have you believe, you can start building stuff with a text editor, a web browser and HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
